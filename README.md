# Wolkamen
I will try to do a Pygame-based Wolfenstein copy called Wolkamen (Волкамень) because here I will replace the Germans with the Russians.

## Setting 
The game is set during a fictional war between Ukraine and Russia.

## Main Character 
You play as a brave Ukrainian soldier named Ivan Kovalenko.

## Story

Ivan Kovalenko, a highly decorated soldier from Ukraine, is captured by the Russian forces during a reconnaissance mission. He is taken to a high-security prison fortress named “Wolkamen”, located deep within the Ural Mountains.

Despite the harsh conditions and brutal treatment, Ivan remains unbroken. He begins to plan his escape, gathering information and making allies among the other prisoners.

One day, Ivan stumbles upon a dark secret. The Russians are working on a mysterious and dangerous project within the fortress. Codenamed “Operation Red Star”, the project aims to create super soldiers using advanced and untested technology.

Realizing the implications of this project, Ivan decides not just to escape, but also to sabotage the project and save his homeland from this impending threat.

The game follows Ivan’s perilous journey as he fights his way through the fortress, sabotages the project, and confronts the mastermind behind Operation Red Star.
