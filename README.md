# Wolkamen
I will try to do a Pygame-based Wolfenstein copy called Wolkamen (Волкамень) because here I will replace the Germans with the Russians.

## Setting 
The game is set during the Russian invasion of Ukraine (the timeline can be considered real since it was done after February 24th 2022 but the setting and characters are completely fictional).

## Main Character 
You play as a brave Ukrainian soldier named Ivan Kovalenko.

## Story

Ivan Kovalenko, a highly decorated soldier from Ukraine, is captured by the Russian forces during a reconnaissance mission near Avdiika. He is taken to a high-security prison fortress named “Wolkamen”, located deep within the Ural Mountains.

Despite the harsh conditions and brutal treatment, Ivan remains unbroken. He begins to plan his escape, gathering information and making allies among the other prisoners.

One day, Ivan stumbles upon a dark secret. The Russians are working on a mysterious and dangerous project within the fortress. Codenamed “Operation ZOV” (a reference to the Russian propaganda that uses these symbols, especially the "Z" one), the project aims to create super soldiers using advanced and untested technology in order to take over the World by first invading Ukraine, and then invading Poland, the Baltics (Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania), Finland, Romania and so on....

Realizing the implications of this project, Ivan decides not just to escape, but also to sabotage the project and save his homeland from this impending threat.

The game follows Ivan’s perilous journey as he fights his way through the fortress, sabotages the project, and confronts the mastermind behind Operation ZOV.

For me this is a game that is fighting against the War that happen in Ukraine and against Russian Imperialism.
